   To install OpenSSH-Server on a Debian-based system, issue the following
 commands to install:

     # Update package manager cache
     user@host:~$ sudo apt update
     # If it warns of any new packages, just upgrade them. Do consider that
     # you might need to reboot for some of the new upgrades to take affect.

     # Install OpenSSH-Server
     user@host:~$ sudo apt install -y openssh-server

   Once the package is finished installing, configure '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'
 as per your local security practices. Examples can be found further into this
 documentation project.
