Using systemd utilties to perform basic management of OpenSSH-Server:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   Most modern Linux distros will enable, and start OpenSSH Server immediately
 after the package is installed. So, with that in mind. Review the sshd_config
 file found under /etc/ssh and continue reading, or just read, or continue, or
 I don't know, you got this far, just read!


Start the ssh server:
   To start OpenSSH Server, issue the following on a systemd based system:

     # I'm using the 'ssh' alias. 'ssh.service' otherwise!
     user@host:~$ sudo systemctl start ssh

     # If you've changed configurations mid-flight, reload is your friend.
     user@host:~$ sudo systemctl reload ssh

     # If you wish to restart ssh after an on disk upgrade, issue:
     user@host:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh

     # To enable ssh to start during Linux boot up sequence!
     user@host:~$ sudo systemctl enable ssh

     # If you have any reason to bring it to a stop, issue:
     user@host:~$ sudo systemctl stop ssh

     # For when you want to know its current running state
     user@host:~$ systemctl status ssh

     # To list all logs associated to ssh
     user@host:~$ journalctl -u ssh
