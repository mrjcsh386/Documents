About OpenSSH-server:
'''''''''''''''''''''
   OpenSSH is a standard and protocol that was started by the BSD crowd. It's
 intention was to build a remote shell service that held data integrity with
 encryption across the wire. To inspect SSH connections over the wire, you'll
 notice that the negotiations, and handshakes it goes through are equivallent
 to SSL connections. Both use the same algorithms to encrypt traffic. If you're
 the top to distro hop on the regular, you might've noticed that to install
 openssh beit for the client, or the server, you'll end up with the same
 package. Debian stands out by dividing openssh into two packages,
 openssh-client, and openssh-server respectively.
