   The minimal and recommended hardware requirements for running an OpenSSH
 server is not explicitly defined by the OpenSSH project, as the requirements
 largely depend on the specific use case and workload. However, general
 guidelines can be provided based on typical usage scenarios.


Minimal Hardware Requirements:
   For minimal usage, such as running an OpenSSH server for a few users with
 light to moderate traffic, the requirements are quite low:

 - CPU: 1 GHz single-core processor
 - RAM: 256 MB
 - Storage: 100 MB for OpenSSH and related files, more depending on logs
   and user data(/home/user et al).
 - Network: Basic network interfacing.


Recommended Hardware Requirements:
   For a more robust setup, especially in environments with multiple users
 or higher traffic, the recommended hardware requirements would be higher to
 ensure smooth performance.

 - CPU: Multi-core processor (e.g., 2 GHz dual core or better)
 - RAM: 1 GB or more
 - Storage: 500 MB for OpenSSH and related files, more depending on logs,
   user data, and other installed applications such as MoSH.
 - Network: High-speed network interface card with support for gigabit Ethernet


Additional Considerations:

 1. Scalability: If you expect a significant increase in the number of users
    or the amount of traffic, consider more powerful hardware with additional
    CPU cores and RAM.

 2. Security: For enhanced security, especially in enterprise environments,
    consider dedicated hardware for the OpenSSH server to isolate it from
    other services.

 3. Redundancy: Implement RAID for storage redundancy and consider using
    multiple network interfaces for failover and load balancing.

 4. Virtualization: If running the OpenSSH server in a virtualized environment,
    allocate sufficient virtual resources to meet the above requirements.

   These guidelines should help you determine the appropriate hardware for
 your specific OpenSSH server needs.
