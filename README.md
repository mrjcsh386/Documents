# Documents

Welcome to the **Documents** repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for documenting the software tools, libraries, and technologies I have utilized in various projects.

## Purpose

You will find information on different use cases, workflows, and environmental examples to reproduce said use cases.

Apart from the README.md, all documentation will be shared using the dot.txt format, as I'm anticipating the use of the documents on TUI environments. In addition, I will be keeping a character width of no more than 80 as this is the norm for Terminal User Interfaces.

## Structure

1. **Program_1**/
  - 1_About.txt
  - **2_Requirements**/
    - hardware.txt:
      Such qualities as vt-x and what not for say Xen?
    - build_environment.txt:
      Preperations for building the solution from source code.
  - **3_Install**/
    - apt.txt
    - pacman.txt
    - Make.txt
  - **4_Usage**/
    - This directory will be structured with prefixes to denote the intention of each file.
      - 01-Post_Install.*.txt
      - 02-Basic_Usage.*.txt
      - 03-Advanced_Usage.*.txt
      - 04-Configuration.*.txt
  - **5_Notes**/
    - legal.txt: Will include license, and may include regulations to qualities intended to be present by the project. (AFAIK, UK has restrictions with encryption.).
    - Warnings.txt: Some solutions might have spicy consequences.
  - 6_Versions.txt: Hopefully I can expand on support point releases, and what makes each one interesting.
  - **7_References**/
    links to various avenues for support and examples i.e.,
    - bloggers.txt
    - FAQ.txt
    - IRC.txt
    - Wiki.txt
2. **Git**/
  - 1_About.txt
  - **2_Requirements**/
  - **3_Install**/
  - **4_Usage**/
  - **5_Notes**/
  - 6_Versions.txt
  - **7_References**/

Each directory within the 'Documents' folder represents a different software tool or library and contains a directory structure that permits ease of navigation and file names that are self descriptive to use cases, or their own point.

## How to Use

1. **Browse**: Navigate through the directories to find the software tool or library you are interested in.
2. **Read**: Open the '1_About.txt' file within the respective directory to get an overview of the tool.
3. **Learn**: Consult the file that self describes itself to your current interest. Are you new to it? Exploring different usages?
4. **Explore**: Check the '7_References/' directory for additional resources and official documentation.
