Making LibreOffice more compatible with Microsoft Office:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   As is the case with all software, once you've used it for extended periods
 of time, you tend to get used to it. If you're making the transition between
 the Microsoft suite of tools for office work to LibreOffice, or need to support
 your staff in the transition from the one to the other, here you will find a
 list of recommendations and steps to implement them.


# Ribbon:
   You might have already noticed a lack of ribbon at the top of LibreOffice
 coming from a Microsoft Office suite background. Although it isn't perfect,
 you can get some of that familiarity back by following these steps:

 1. Starting from the menu bar at the top, find 'view' and select it to 
    a drop down menu.

 2. Select the entry 'User Interface'.

 3. You will be presented with a series of options, the one that best
    matches the MS Ribbon, is 'Tabbed'.

 4. After you have applied 'Tabbed', select the 'Main' menu by clicking
    on the 3 over-lapping bars on the far right top hand corner.

 5. Once the drop down menu has become visible, click 'Options'.

 6. In the left hand menu pane, you will see 'View'. Select 'View'.

 7. Under the 'Theme:' drop down menu, 'Colibre SVG'

 8.1. If you find the layout not to your liking, you can re-order the
    placement by opening 'Main' menu(3 over-lapping bars far top right).

 8.2  Select the entry 'Customize'.

 8.3  Under the tab 'Notebookbar' you will find a host of features grouped
    as well as in a (un)selected state by way of radio bars. To re-order or
    add/remove features, You can select a feature and drag-and-drop the
    item where ever you choose.

    I leave you here to venture through your customization. If you really
    want to keep your muscle memory after re-ordering the tabs to fit MS
    Ribbon layout, you might want to have a look at the 'Keyboard' tab.


# Fonts:
   By default, LibreOffice is not equiped with some of the key fonts that you
 can find in MS-Word. Here, I will show you how to install those fonts so that
 you can bet your resume isn't unprintable from MS-Words perspective.

 | Note: Despite LibreOffice having a suite of fonts that are near perfect
 |   font comparison, there are subtle variations between them that can
 |   scramble your formatting of your documents when shared between the
 |   two office families. So, for this, I suggest installing these fonts.

 1. Open a terminal window, or your choice of GUI package manager and
    search for the package 'ttf-mscorefonts-installer'. If this package
    isn't visible, you'll need to enable additional repositories. For my
    Debian 12 system, I had to enable 'contrib'. Ubuntu, you'll need to
    enable 'multiverse'.

 Issue the following commands after enabling, or carrying on with the guide:

     user@host:~$ sudo apt update
     user@host:~$ sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

 You might need to accept licensing! If you missed your chance, you can issue
 the command 'sudo apt install --reinstall ttf-mscorefonts-installer'.


# File format and compatibility:
   Now that we've taken care of the visual elements of compatibility, let's
 have a look at making the file formating more like MS-Word as a default.

 1. Select the 'Main' menu icon(3 layer bar far top right).

 2. Choose 'Options'

 3. In the left-hand pane, select 'Load/Save' and click on 'Microsoft Office'.

 4. Make sure all the radio buttons are selected! Most often than not, they are
    save 'SmartArt to LibreOffice shapes or reverse'. Ensure you enable that
    feature.

 5. While we still have the 'Options' box available, select from the left-hand
    pane, 'LibreOffice Writer' and choose 'Compatibility'.

 6. Enable these two options:
    - 'Reorganize Form menu for Microsoft compatibility'
    - 'Word-compatible trailing blanks'

 7. In the left-hand pane, once again, select 'Load/Save', and choose 'General'

 8. Switch the default save as file format to docx by selecting the drop-down
    menu under 'Default File Format and ODF Settings' labelled as,
    'Always save as'. Change it to 'Word 2007-365 (*.docx)'.


# Templates:

 1. On the 'File' tab in your new found Ribbon, select 'Templates'

 2. On the top right-hand side, select the drop down 'Manage'

 3. Select 'Import'

    Select the type of Template you wish to import, and drill through your
    filesystem to find your template of choice!
