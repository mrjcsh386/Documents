About Azure-CLI:
''''''''''''''''
   The Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) is a powerful tool designed to
 help developers, administrators, and DevOps engineers manage and interact
 with Azure resources through a command-line interface.

 1. Resource Management
 ''''''''''''''''''''''
   - Provisioning and Managing Resources: Azure CLI allows you to create,
     configure, and manage Azure resources such as virtual machines,
     storage accounts, databases, networks, and more, directly from the
     command line.
   - Automation: It can be easily integrated into scripts for automating tasks.
     This is particularly useful for repetitive tasks, such as deploying
     instructions, scaling services, and monitoring resources.

 2. Cross-Platform Functionality
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   - Host Agnostic: Azure CLI is available on multiple operating systems,
     including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. This makes it accessible to a
     wide range of users, regardless of their development environment.
   - Consistency: It provides a consistent interface across different
     platforms, allowing users to perform the same work despite their
     working environment.

 3. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   - DevOps and CI/CD Deployments: Azure CLI can be integrated into CI/CD
     pipelines to as a component to automate the deployment of resources
     for easier testing cycles.

 4. Scripting and Automation
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   - Batch Operations: With some of the tooling available in azure-cli,
     you can perform multiple actions simultaneous across a pool of
     resources helping you to avoid the repitition of administration of
     multiple hosts.
   - Scripting: Since az is found within your PATH variable, you can use
     the utility as a component of scripts tailored for your own use case.

 5. Support for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
   - Template Deployment: Azure CLI can be used to deploy Azure Resource
     Manager (ARM) templates, enabling you to maintain consistent
     environments.

 The Azure CLI with its flexibility simplifies the management, automation,
 and orchestration of Azure resources. Despite its weird learning curve
 and breadth of sub-functions. This tool is essential to learn when working
 with Azure cloud services.
